# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.



```{r 4}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
skimr::skim(yrbss)
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis


```{r, eda_on_weight}

weight_summary <- yrbss %>% 
  #group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_weight = median(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_weight = min(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_weight = max(weight, na.rm=TRUE))

weight_summary

```
```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("challenge1.png", error = FALSE)
```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

  
```{r 5}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss %>% filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

```
A 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week

```{r, boxplot}

prop_no <- 0.331
prop_yes <- 0.669

se_physical_3plus_no <- sqrt(prop_yes*(1-prop_yes)/nrow(yrbss))

lower_CI_95 <- prop_no - 1.96*se_physical_3plus_no

upper_CI_95 <- prop_no + 1.96*se_physical_3plus_no

se_physical_3plus_no
lower_CI_95
upper_CI_95

```

A boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`


```{r challenge2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("challenge2.png", error = FALSE)
```

The box plot shows that the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum of the weight of those who exercise 3+ times a week is higher than the equivalent for the ones that do not exercise as much

This result is odd as we would expect people who exercise to be healthier and therefore have a lower weight than people who don't. This may be due to the fact that health and weight are sometimes wrongly connected.


## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean/SD, etc weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r 6}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.


## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

The null hypothesis is when the mean weight of individuals who work out more than 3 times a week equals the mean weight of those who work out 2 times or less per week.
The alternative hypothesis is when these two values are not equal.
To assess which one is correct, we can run a t-test as below:
```{r 7}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```
The 95% confidence interval does not include Zero which means that the two means are not equal (with 95% confidence), that confirms the alternative hypothesis.
